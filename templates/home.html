<div class="title">Debutante</div>

<p>For me, I think it always starts with the music. It's always the music, the production- the tone and overarching feelings first. Always. Maybe honing it all the way down, tone is the key one I think. Anyways, I guess I was listening to a lot of fucking
    Nick Cave and The Wolfgang Press at the time and feeling very antsy about finally finishing school. I mean, every 4 months I'm in a new city- that's just the reality of the lifestyle that my program affords. It doesn't really make building relationships
    or finding people to play these songs with very easy. Computer Science has forced me to be a very logical thinker; I can't just pretend like it doesn't fucking matter, you know? It's a weird thing because you go to a party or a freak punk show in
    Ottawa or St. Catharines when I wrote these songs, and meet these interesting people but it's like- I know that I'm probably not going to ever see you again, so why are we talking about our programs? Ugh, fuck I just want to be done school so I can
    finally pull the people that I want into my life. Anyways, back to the music. I want to play these songs. I (if you're reading this and you want to fuck some shit up, get at me) A lot of this is improv, especially the vocals

about "Debutante is a departure from "Cyanide Canaries", the enduring surf rock / trip hop endeavor fronted by Brantford, Ontario born Khalil Stemmler. Impressed by the golden era of post-punk from the late 70's and early 80s, if one would "Watch Closely"
or rather, listen- influences can be traced back to Andy Gill's stringent guitar riffs, the violent fetishism of The Birthday Party and occassional delivery of The Wolfgang Press." - Asia Ferreira "gritty textures, dangerous intimations, and a sense of
caustic longing... DEBUTANTE is the belle of the ball, and kids the auditorium is definitely on fire... defined by sharp grooves and razor-rainstorm guitars, this music revisits the early 80s postpunk moment without any of the usual pained nostalgia.
these songs want to hurt you the way you hurt them." - Caligula Jr, resident psychedelic cave monster "Debutante explores their post-punk leanings with exciting and guttural guitars and electronically altered vocals." - Mark Anthony Brennan
